# React Intro

## Create React app

To install create-react-app:

```powershell
npm install -g create-react-app
```

to use the command:

```powershell
create-react-app lake-app
```

Then you will have react project template with required dependencies such as react.js, react-dom.js, babel.js, webpack.js, etc.

To install dependencies navigate to the project folder *lake-app* then run:

```powershell
npm install
```

to run the project:

```powershell
npm start
```

To publish your application for production use (optimize app version):

```powershell
npm run build
```

To run your production application, run:

```powershell
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

serve is a static server to serve our application locally.
